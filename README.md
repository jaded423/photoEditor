$ cat /problem.md
product photography for a multi-SKU catalog. dozens of new SKUs per week.
each photo needs: background removed, square-cropped, scaled to 1000×1000,
optionally banner-stamped with the SKU filename. doing it by hand in
photoshop = death.

PhotoEditor: point at a folder, hit "Process". 200 photos → 5 minutes.

$ ls outputs/
pendingProducts/   # no banner — clean for catalog upload
edited/            # with banner — filename overlay for review
original/          # source moved here (recoverable)
```

## ✨ What it does

**Input:** a folder of product photos / videos (mixed formats — JPG, PNG, MP4).

**Pipeline:**

1. **Background removal** — `rembg` with the `birefnet-general` model. Filename prefix `smalls` skips this step (pile shots, bulk product fills the frame already)
2. **Bulk detection** — if rembg kept >85% coverage (no clear subject) OR <5% coverage (over-removed), falls back to the original. Saves the "pile of nugs" case
3. **Component cleanup** — keeps everything connected to the main subject. Strips only small distant fragments (alpha > 30 threshold)
4. **Smart resize** — crops to subject bounding box, scales to 900×900, centers on a 1000×1000 transparent canvas with a 50px border
5. **Outputs**:
   - `pendingProducts/` — clean square PNG, no banner (catalog-ready)
   - `edited/` — same image + SKU filename banner overlaid (review-ready)
   - `original/` — source files moved here (nothing destroyed)

**UI:** native macOS Tkinter. Pick folder, hit Process. Progress bar + log window.

## 🧠 Why it exists

Product photography pipeline for a multi-brand catalog. Built originally for an internal team that ships hundreds of new product photos per week. Open-sourced because the pattern is generic — anyone running a catalog with manual photo-prep grind can use it as-is or adapt.

The "bulk detection" heuristic in step 2 came out of real-world failure modes: `rembg` would over-remove on photos of piled product (no clear subject to keep) and produce empty PNGs. The coverage-percentage fallback turned a manual triage step into one heuristic.

## 📦 Photo type matrix

| Type | Example filename | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Single subject | `jar-001.jpg` | Full pipeline: bg removal + resize + banner |
| Bulk / pile | `smalls-batch-3.jpg` | Skip bg removal (filename prefix), resize only |
| Middle-ground (scattered) | `jar-with-scatter.jpg` | Full pipeline, keeps scattered pieces (component cleanup tuned to not strip them) |
| Over-removed by rembg | (auto-detected) | Falls back to original |

## 🚀 Install

**End users (Mac, no Python required):** see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the .app download + macOS Gatekeeper walkthrough.

**Developers (build from source):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaded423/photoEditor.git
cd photoEditor

# Requires Python 3.13 at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/
./build_app.sh           # → dist/PhotoEditor.app
./build_app.sh --clean   # clean build artifacts first

# Or run directly without packaging
./run_python.sh
```

## 🤖 AI-assisted, end-to-end

Built through iterative dialogue with Claude (Anthropic). The hardest part wasn't `rembg` — it was the heuristic for "did the background-removal step actually work, or did it make things worse?" That came out of pairing on real failure cases.

Same approach behind everything at [jadedviber.com](https://jadedviber.com).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| App won't open after install | See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) — Gatekeeper walkthrough |
| "PhotoEditor.app is damaged" | Re-download the zip; archive corrupted during transfer |
| All photos coming out empty | Check `~/Library/Logs/CombinedProcessor/` — likely a model download issue on first launch |
| First photo hangs for minutes | Normal on first-ever launch — rembg downloads the `birefnet-general` model (~928MB) to `~/.u2net/`. Later photos are fast |
| Crashes on launch | Ensure macOS 12+ (Monterey or later) |
